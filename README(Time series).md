# Task 1 – Time Series Prediction

## 📌 Brief Task Description
This task focuses on time series prediction, where historical data collected over time is analyzed to forecast future values. Since time series data has a temporal structure, the order of observations is preserved while exploring patterns such as trends and variations. Visualizations are used to understand how the data evolves over time and to gain insights before modeling.

A predictive model is then trained on past observations to estimate future values, ensuring a time-aware train–test split to avoid data leakage. The model’s predictions are compared with actual values and visualized for interpretation. This task demonstrates a clear understanding of time-dependent data, forecasting workflow, and result analysis
